# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I’m transitioning from a biology background into data science.
This portfolio showcases projects that demonstrate my development in data
analysis, coding, and applied problem-solving, with a focus on healthcare
and public health applications.

I am currently completing prerequisite coursework in preparation for a
Master’s in Data Science, with interests in healthcare analytics and
population-level data analysis.
