df["turnaround_hours"] = (df["completed_time"] - df["received_time"]).dt.total_seconds() / 3600



#What’s the average lab turnaround time (TAT)?
#Analyze by groups
Mean turnaround by:
test type
priority (STAT vs routine)
department (if using intermediate dataset)
weekday / shift (if using advanced dataset)




#Do turnaround times differ by department or test type?




#Are urgent (“STAT”) tests completed faster than routine ones?




#Which shifts or days have the slowest turnaround?




#Are there patterns suggesting staffing or workflow issues?







#Visualize

#summarize
Write your takeaways as if you’re reporting to management:

“Average turnaround for routine tests was 3.6 hours vs. 1.2 for STAT tests.
The hematology department had the fastest processing times, while microbiology lagged during night shifts.
Recommending shift-level staffing review.”
