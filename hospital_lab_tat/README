# Hospital Lab Turnaround Time Analysis

This project analyzes laboratory test turnaround times (TAT) from a hospital lab to identify delays and process inefficiencies.

---

## Objectives
- Calculate average and median turnaround times by test type.
- Visualize daily TAT trends and highlight outliers.
- Suggest operational improvements based on findings.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Simulated hospital lab data (1,000 samples)
- **Columns:** `test_type`, `received_time`, `completed_time`, `technician_id`

---

## Methods
1. Parsed timestamps and calculated duration (`completed - received`).
2. Grouped by test type and visualized turnaround times.
3. Flagged any tests exceeding 90th percentile as potential delays.

---

## Results
- Mean TAT for *Blood Chemistry* tests: **2.1 hrs**
- Mean TAT for *Microbiology* tests: **5.6 hrs**
- Identified a batch process bottleneck between 10 AM–1 PM.

## 💡 Next Steps
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard.
- Incorporate real hospital lab metrics once available.
