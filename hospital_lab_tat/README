# Hospital Lab Turnaround Time Analysis

This project analyzes laboratory test turnaround times (TAT) from a hospital lab to identify delays and process inefficiencies.

---

## Objectives
- Calculate average and median turnaround times by test type.
- Visualize daily TAT trends and highlight outliers.
- Suggest operational improvements based on findings.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Simulated hospital lab data (1,000 samples)
- **Columns:** `test_type`, `received_time`, `completed_time`, `technician_id`, 'result_flag', 'department', and 'priority'


---

## Methods
1. Parsed timestamps and calculated duration (`completed - received`).
2. Grouped by test type, department, priority, and result flag and visualized turnaround times.
---
